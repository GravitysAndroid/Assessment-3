                <h1>Brown Bears</h1>
                <div class="content">
                    <h2>Grizzly Bears</h2>
                    <p>Brown bear, (Ursus arctos), shaggy-haired bear (family Ursidae) native to Europe, Asia, and northwestern North America. 
                        More than 80 forms of the brown bear have been described; they are treated as several subspecies of Ursus arctos. 
                        North American brown bears are traditionally called grizzlies
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Diet and hibernation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Brown bears are omnivorous and feed on berries, plant roots and shoots, small mammals, fish, calves of many hoofed animals, and carrion. 
                        They often cache food in shallow holes, and they dig readily and vigorously in search of rodents. 
                        Except in some southern areas, bears retire to dens in winter; they accumulate large amounts of fat during late summer and autumn. 
                        Cubs, usually twins, are born in winter after about six to eight months of gestation. 
                        At birth a cub weighs less than a kilogram.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The brown bear is often described as nocturnal. 
                        However, it frequently seems to peak in activity in the morning and early evening hours.
                        Studies have shown that activity throughout the range can occur at nearly any time of night or day, with bears who dwell in areas with more extensive human contact being more likely to be fully nocturnal. 
                        Furthermore, yearling and newly independent bears are more likely to be active diurnally and many adult bears in low-disturbance areas are largely crepuscular.
                        In summer through autumn, a brown bear can double its weight from the spring, gaining up to 180 kg (400 lb) of fat, on which it relies to make it through winter, when it becomes very lethargic.
                        Although they are not full hibernators and can be woken easily, both sexes like to den in a protected spot during the winter months. 
                        Hibernation dens may consist of any spot that provides cover from the elements and that can accommodate their bodies, such as a cave, crevice, cavernous tree roots, or hollow logs.
                    </p>
                    <br>      
                    <h2>Statistics</h2>    
                    <p>
                        Eurasian brown bears are generally solitary animals that are able to run and swim well. 
                        They are usually 120–210 cm (about 48–83 inches) long and weigh 135–250 kg (300–550 pounds); 
                        the exceptionally large Siberian brown bear (Ursus arctos beringianus), weighing as much as 360 kg (800 pounds), 
                        approximates the size of the North American grizzly. 
                        Coat colour is highly variable, ranging from grayish white through bluish and brownish shades to almost black. 
                        Eurasian brown bears are commonly seen in zoos; 
                        formerly they were often trained to move rhythmically to music—the so-called dancing bears of European carnivals and festivals. 
                        They once roamed most of Europe and Asia; however, the animal’s southern range has been significantly reduced.
                    </p>
                    <br>                                  
                    <h2>Population and human interaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Brown bears have an extremely large geographic distribution, and their worldwide population totals more than 200,000 individuals. 
                        For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species has classified the brown bear as a species of least concern. 
                        Brown bears living in close proximity to humans are often regarded as pests because of the animals’ attraction to human foods. 
                        Their large size and relatively aggressive disposition can unsettle people who come in contact with them, 
                        and brown bears that frequent human settlements are sometimes killed by landowners and government officials. 
                        Other sources of brown bear mortality include collisions with trains and automobiles, poaching, and sport hunting. 
                        In addition, the gallbladder and bile of some brown bears are harvested to make traditional medicines that purportedly alleviate digestive problems and inflammation and purify the blood. 
                        Many harvesting operations also remove and sell the animals’ paws, which are considered a delicacy in parts of Asia. 
                        The Ainu people of Japan worship the brown bear as a god of the mountains, and some mountain-dwelling Ainu consider the bear their ancestor.

                <h1>Tigers</h1>
                <div class="contentAbout">
                    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body. 
                        Its pelage is dense and heavy, and colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes 
                        that are unique in each individual.
                        Stripes are likely advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade.
                        The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids.
                        A tiger's coat pattern is still visible when it is shaved. 
                        This is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and hair follicles embedded in the skin, similar to human beards, and is in common with other big cats.
                        They have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. 
                        The pupils are circular with yellow irises. The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black.
                        These spots are thought to play an important role in intraspecific communication.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                            
                    <h2>Habitat</h2>    
                    <p>
                        The tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey and Transcaucasia to the coast of the Sea of Japan, and from South Asia across Southeast Asia to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali.
                        Since the end of the last glacial period, it was probably restricted by periods of deep snow lasting longer than six months.
                        Currently, it occurs in less then 6% of its historical range, as it has been extirpated from Southwest and Central Asia, large parts of Southeast and East Asia. 
                        It now mainly occurs in the Indian subcontinent, the Indochinese Peninsula, Sumatra and the Russian Far East. 
                        In China and Myanmar, breeding populations appear to rely on immigration from neighbouring countries while its status in the Korean Peninsula is unknown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tiger is essentially associated with forest habitats.
                        Tiger populations thrive where populations of wild cervids, bovids and suids are stable.
                        On the Indian subcontinent, it mainly inhabits tall grasslands and riverine forests as well as the swamp forests of the Sundarbans. 
                        In Thailand, it inhabits mixed deciduous, dry evergreen and dry dipterocarp forests.
                        In Sumatra, tiger populations range from lowland peat swamp forests to rugged montane forests.
                        In the Amur-Ussuri region, it inhabits Korean pine and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, where riparian forests provide food and water, 
                        and serve as dispersal corridors for both tiger and ungulates.
                        Historical records in Iran are known only from the southern coast of the Caspian Sea and adjacent Alborz Mountains.
                        Records in Central Asia indicate that it occurred foremost in Tugay riverine forests along the Atrek, Amu Darya, Syr Darya, Hari, Chu and Ili Rivers and their tributaries. 
                        In the Caucasus, it inhabited hilly and lowland forests.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized mammals, particularly ungulates weighing 60–250 kg (130–550 lb). 
                        Range-wide, sambar deer, Manchurian wapiti, barasingha and wild boar are significantly preferred. 
                        Tigers are capable of taking down larger prey like adult gaur but will also opportunistically eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.
                        They also prey on other predators, including dogs, leopards, pythons, bears, and crocodiles.
                        Tigers generally do not prey on fully grown adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros but incidents have been reported.
                        More often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken.
                        When in close proximity to humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys.
                        Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for dietary fibre such as fruit of the slow match tree.
