                <h1>Brown Bears</h1>
                <div class="content">
                    <h2>Grizzly Bears</h2>
                    <p>Brown bear, (Ursus arctos), shaggy-haired bear (family Ursidae) native to Europe, Asia, and northwestern North America. 
                        More than 80 forms of the brown bear have been described; they are treated as several subspecies of Ursus arctos. 
                        North American brown bears are traditionally called grizzlies
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Diet and hibernation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Brown bears are omnivorous and feed on berries, plant roots and shoots, small mammals, fish, calves of many hoofed animals, and carrion. 
                        They often cache food in shallow holes, and they dig readily and vigorously in search of rodents. 
                        Except in some southern areas, bears retire to dens in winter; they accumulate large amounts of fat during late summer and autumn. 
                        Cubs, usually twins, are born in winter after about six to eight months of gestation. 
                        At birth a cub weighs less than a kilogram.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The brown bear is often described as nocturnal. 
                        However, it frequently seems to peak in activity in the morning and early evening hours.
                        Studies have shown that activity throughout the range can occur at nearly any time of night or day, with bears who dwell in areas with more extensive human contact being more likely to be fully nocturnal. 
                        Furthermore, yearling and newly independent bears are more likely to be active diurnally and many adult bears in low-disturbance areas are largely crepuscular.
                        In summer through autumn, a brown bear can double its weight from the spring, gaining up to 180 kg (400 lb) of fat, on which it relies to make it through winter, when it becomes very lethargic.
                        Although they are not full hibernators and can be woken easily, both sexes like to den in a protected spot during the winter months. 
                        Hibernation dens may consist of any spot that provides cover from the elements and that can accommodate their bodies, such as a cave, crevice, cavernous tree roots, or hollow logs.
                    </p>
                    <br>      
                    <h2>Statistics</h2>    
                    <p>
                        Eurasian brown bears are generally solitary animals that are able to run and swim well. 
                        They are usually 120–210 cm (about 48–83 inches) long and weigh 135–250 kg (300–550 pounds); 
                        the exceptionally large Siberian brown bear (Ursus arctos beringianus), weighing as much as 360 kg (800 pounds), 
                        approximates the size of the North American grizzly. 
                        Coat colour is highly variable, ranging from grayish white through bluish and brownish shades to almost black. 
                        Eurasian brown bears are commonly seen in zoos; 
                        formerly they were often trained to move rhythmically to music—the so-called dancing bears of European carnivals and festivals. 
                        They once roamed most of Europe and Asia; however, the animal’s southern range has been significantly reduced.
                    </p>
                    <br>                                  
                    <h2>Population and human interaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Brown bears have an extremely large geographic distribution, and their worldwide population totals more than 200,000 individuals. 
                        For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species has classified the brown bear as a species of least concern. 
                        Brown bears living in close proximity to humans are often regarded as pests because of the animals’ attraction to human foods. 
                        Their large size and relatively aggressive disposition can unsettle people who come in contact with them, 
                        and brown bears that frequent human settlements are sometimes killed by landowners and government officials. 
                        Other sources of brown bear mortality include collisions with trains and automobiles, poaching, and sport hunting. 
                        In addition, the gallbladder and bile of some brown bears are harvested to make traditional medicines that purportedly alleviate digestive problems and inflammation and purify the blood. 
                        Many harvesting operations also remove and sell the animals’ paws, which are considered a delicacy in parts of Asia. 
                        The Ainu people of Japan worship the brown bear as a god of the mountains, and some mountain-dwelling Ainu consider the bear their ancestor.

                <h1>Tigers</h1>
                <div class="contentTiger">
                    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body. 
                        Its pelage is dense and heavy, and colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes 
                        that are unique in each individual.
                        Stripes are likely advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade.
                        The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids.
                        A tiger's coat pattern is still visible when it is shaved. 
                        This is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and hair follicles embedded in the skin, similar to human beards, and is in common with other big cats.
                        They have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. 
                        The pupils are circular with yellow irises. The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black.
                        These spots are thought to play an important role in intraspecific communication.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                            
                    <h2>Habitat</h2>    
                    <p>
                        The tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey and Transcaucasia to the coast of the Sea of Japan, and from South Asia across Southeast Asia to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali.
                        Since the end of the last glacial period, it was probably restricted by periods of deep snow lasting longer than six months.
                        Currently, it occurs in less then 6% of its historical range, as it has been extirpated from Southwest and Central Asia, large parts of Southeast and East Asia. 
                        It now mainly occurs in the Indian subcontinent, the Indochinese Peninsula, Sumatra and the Russian Far East. 
                        In China and Myanmar, breeding populations appear to rely on immigration from neighbouring countries while its status in the Korean Peninsula is unknown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tiger is essentially associated with forest habitats.
                        Tiger populations thrive where populations of wild cervids, bovids and suids are stable.
                        On the Indian subcontinent, it mainly inhabits tall grasslands and riverine forests as well as the swamp forests of the Sundarbans. 
                        In Thailand, it inhabits mixed deciduous, dry evergreen and dry dipterocarp forests.
                        In Sumatra, tiger populations range from lowland peat swamp forests to rugged montane forests.
                        In the Amur-Ussuri region, it inhabits Korean pine and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, where riparian forests provide food and water, 
                        and serve as dispersal corridors for both tiger and ungulates.
                        Historical records in Iran are known only from the southern coast of the Caspian Sea and adjacent Alborz Mountains.
                        Records in Central Asia indicate that it occurred foremost in Tugay riverine forests along the Atrek, Amu Darya, Syr Darya, Hari, Chu and Ili Rivers and their tributaries. 
                        In the Caucasus, it inhabited hilly and lowland forests.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Diet</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized mammals, particularly ungulates weighing 60–250 kg (130–550 lb). 
                        Range-wide, sambar deer, Manchurian wapiti, barasingha and wild boar are significantly preferred. 
                        Tigers are capable of taking down larger prey like adult gaur but will also opportunistically eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.
                        They also prey on other predators, including dogs, leopards, pythons, bears, and crocodiles.
                        Tigers generally do not prey on fully grown adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros but incidents have been reported.
                        More often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken.
                        When in close proximity to humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys.
                        Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for dietary fibre such as fruit of the slow match tree.
                    </p>
                    <br> 
                    <h2>Human interaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Wild tigers that have had no prior contact with humans actively avoid interactions with humans. 
                        However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal.
                        Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. 
                        Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between a mother and her young, 
                        or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle.
                        Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. 
                        Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. 
                        Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey.
                        For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines. 
                        She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, 
                        by the time she was shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett.
                        According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch.
                        Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.

                        The wild pig (Sus scrofa) can take advantage of any forage resources.
                        Therefore, it can live in virtually any productive habitat that can provide enough water to sustain large mammals such as pigs. 
                        If there is increased foraging of wild pigs in certain areas, it can cause a nutritional shortage which can cause the pig population to decrease. 
                        If the nutritional state returns to normal, the pig population will most likely rise due to the pigs' naturally increased reproduction rate.

                        Pigs are omnivores, which means that they consume both plants and animals. 
                        In the wild, they are foraging animals, primarily eating leaves, roots, fruits, and flowers, in addition to some insects and fish. 
                        As livestock, pigs are fed mostly corn and soybean meal with a mixture of vitamins and minerals added to the diet. 
                        Older pigs will consume three to five gallons of water per day.
                        When kept as pets, the optimal healthy diet consists mainly of a balanced diet of raw vegetables, 
                        although some may give their pigs conventional mini pig pellet feed.

                        Domesticated pigs, especially miniature breeds, are commonly kept as pets.
                        Domestic pigs are raised commercially as livestock; materials that are garnered include their meat (known as pork), leather, 
                        and their bristly hairs which are used to make brushes. 
                        Because of their foraging abilities and excellent sense of smell, they are used to find truffles in many European countries. 
                        Both wild and feral pigs are commonly hunted.

                        A typical pig has a large head with a long snout that is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and by a disk of cartilage at the tip.
                        The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ. 
                        There are four hoofed toes on each foot, with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight, but the outer two also being used in soft ground.
